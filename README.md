# Newsworthy

### Description
This app displays a list of news stories accessed from The Guardian API.  Users can provide search terms to narrow results.

This project was built for the Udacity Android Developement for Beginners nanodegree.


### What I accomplished in this project:

* Queried an online API for news stories.
* Implemented search functionality to narrow results from the API.
* Parsed the JSON data to generate a list of stories.
* Displayed those stories in a simple RecyclerView
* Utilized implicit intents to open those stories in a browser.
